Hi Team,

I hope you are all doing well.

This is a follow-up on our recent discussion regarding the quarterly
budget review and pending operational items. Please go through the
attached budget file and check the expense allocations carefully.

First, kindly review the logistics and infrastructure costs and send
your feedback by Friday morning. If possible, please try to complete
this at the earliest so that we have enough time to consolidate the
inputs.

Second, please submit the revised numbers for your respective departments
within 2 days. This is important, as the final version needs to be shared
with senior management before the end of business on Thursday.

We also need to schedule a meeting to discuss the revised projections
and next steps. Let us plan to meet tomorrow evening to go through the
details together. If tomorrow evening does not work, we can alternatively
meet on Monday afternoon.

During the meeting, we will also review the pending action items from the
last call, including vendor contract renewals and approval timelines.
Please come prepared with any updates or concerns.

Additionally, I would appreciate it if the final summary report could be
shared by EOD today so that I can review it before tomorrow morning.

If you have any questions or need clarification on any of the above
points, feel free to reach out.

Thanks and regards,
Arjun Mehta
Senior Finance Manager
Company XYZ
